Installation:
-------------
OS X: 
Mount the butt-<version>.dmg by double clicking and 
drop the butt file into the Applications folder.

WINDOWS: 
Just run the butt-<version>-setup.exe as usual and go through the
installer pages.
The default installation path might be unusual, but this way it is possible to install
butt without administration rights.

Linux/MinGW (Windows):
First of all the following libraries have to be installed on your system  
fltk-1.3, portaudio19, libmp3lame, libvorbis, libogg, libflac, 
libopus, libsamplerate, libfdk-aac, libdbus-1, libcurl, libssl, portmidi 
They are quite common and should be included in every popular linux distribution. 

On Ubuntu you can install them with 
sudo apt-get install libfltk1.3-dev portaudio19-dev libopus-dev libmp3lame-dev libvorbis-dev \
libogg-dev libflac-dev libfdk-aac-dev libdbus-1-dev libsamplerate0-dev \
libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libportmidi-dev \

On openSUSE you can install them with 
sudo zypper in fltk-devel portaudio-devel libmp3lame-devel libvorbis-devel libogg-devel flac-devel \
libfdk-aac-devel libopus-devel libopenssl-devel libopus-devel libsamplerate-devel dbus-1-devel \
libcurl-devel portmidi-devel

On Distributions which don't have libfdk-aac like Debian you can compile without aac support: 
./configure --disable-aac

For compiling on Windows I recommend the msys2 x64 (www.msys2.org) environment.
They have all the needed packages in their pacman repository. Additionally you need to install the libwinpthread-git package. 
Make sure that you select the x64 version of each package.

After installing the above libraries you can install butt from source as usual:

tar -xzf butt-<version>.tar.gz
cd butt-<version>
./configure
make
sudo make install

 
In case the included configure script or the make process fails on your system, try to create a new configure script by invoking:
autoreconf -i and start with ./configure again.
